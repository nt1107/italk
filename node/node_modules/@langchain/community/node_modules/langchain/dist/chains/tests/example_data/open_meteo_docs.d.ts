Time always starts at 0:00 today and contains 168 hours. All URL parameters are listed below:\n\nParameter\tFormat\tRequired\tDefault\tDescription\nlatitude, longitude\tFloating point\tYes\t\tGeographical WGS84 coordinate of the location\nhourly\tString array\tNo\t\tA list of weather variables which should be returned. Values can be comma separated, or multiple &hourly= parameter in the URL can be used.\ndaily\tString array\tNo\t\tA list of daily weather variable aggregations which should be returned. Values can be comma separated, or multiple &daily= parameter in the URL can be used. If daily weather variables are specified, parameter timezone is required.\ncurrent_weather\tBool\tNo\tfalse\tInclude current weather conditions in the JSON output.\ntemperature_unit\tString\tNo\tcelsius\tIf fahrenheit is set, all temperature values are converted to Fahrenheit.\nwindspeed_unit\tString\tNo\tkmh\tOther wind speed speed units: ms, mph and kn\nprecipitation_unit\tString\tNo\tmm\tOther precipitation amount units: inch\ntimeformat\tString\tNo\tiso8601\tIf format unixtime is selected, all time values are returned in UNIX epoch time in seconds. Please note that all timestamp are in GMT+0! For daily values with unix timestamps, please apply utc_offset_seconds again to get the correct date.\ntimezone\tString\tNo\tGMT\tIf timezone is set, all timestamps are returned as local-time and data is returned starting at 00:00 local-time. Any time zone name from the time zone database is supported. If auto is set as a time zone, the coordinates will be automatically resolved to the local time zone.\npast_days\tInteger (0-2)\tNo\t0\tIf past_days is set, yesterday or the day before yesterday data are also returned.\nstart_date\nend_date\tString (yyyy-mm-dd)\tNo\t\tThe time interval to get weather data. A day must be specified as an ISO8601 date (e.g. 2022-06-30).\nmodels\tString array\tNo\tauto\tManually select one or more weather models. Per default, the best suitable weather models will be combined.\n\nVariable\tValid time\tUnit\tDescription\ntemperature_2m\tInstant\t\u00B0C (\u00B0F)\tAir temperature at 2 meters above ground\nsnowfall\tPreceding hour sum\tcm (inch)\tSnowfall amount of the preceding hour in centimeters.
